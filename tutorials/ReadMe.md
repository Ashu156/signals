## Description:

This 'tutorials' folder contains files that are useful for learning how to use *Signals*. 

## Contents:

- 'Getting_Started_with_Signals': Those new to *Signals* should start here. This script contains information on how a *Signals* network works, how signals interact with each other in a *Signals* network, and how to create signals in a *Signals* network using common MATLAB and *Signals* specific methods.

- 'Getting_Started_with_Signals_Answers': A script containing answers to questions posed in 'Getting_Started_with_Signals'

- 'signalsExperimentTutorial': This file is a tutorial for creating a *Signals* Experiment Definition (aka an 'Exp Def'). Exp Defs are the files that are executed when running a *Signals* Experiment within Rigbox. This tutorial walks through setting up and running different versions of a *Signals* Experiment based on the [Burgess Steering Wheel Task](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/07/25/051912.full.pdf).

- 'signalsExperimentTutorialAnswers': A script containing answers to questions posed in 'signalsExperimentTutorial'

- 'signalsExamplesScript': This script contains additional information on how *Signals* works. It also contains examples of *Signals-y* things which may not have been covered in the above files, and which an experimenter may be able incorporate into their Experiment Definitions.

## Instructions on Running Exp Defs from 'signalsExperimentTutorial'

0) Open 'signalsExperimentTutorial' in MATLAB and make sure you read the notes there carefully before continuing.

1) On a rig:

- Run 'mc' in MATLAB on the 'mc' computer
- When the 'MC' gui appears, from the dropdown menus in the upper left, select:

  - Subject: 'default'
  - Type: '<custom...>' (then select the file 'signalsExperimentTutorial' when the file explorer opens)
  - Rig: Choose the rig on which you are currently running 'expServer'
  - Saved sets: <defaults> (then click the 'Load' push button)

- Click the 'Start' push button to start the experiment. 
- (If you are on the final section of the tutorial, parameters will appear as editable fields that you can click on to edit)

2) On a personal PC:

- Run 'expTestPanel' in MATLAB
- Select 'signalsExperimentTutorial' when the file explorer appears, then click the 'Apply Parameters', followed by the 'Play' push buttons in the GUI. The computer mouse will be set to emulate the wheel, controlling the visual stimulus.
